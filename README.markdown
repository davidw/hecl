Hecl Programming Language
=========================

The Hecl Programming Language is an attempt to create a programming
language that works the way I want it to.  The goals I have in mind
are:

* Simplicity.  The language shouldn't be complicated.  It should
  "scale down", which means that even someone without much experience
  programming ought to be able to use it and be productive with it,
  even if their code isn't beautiful.

* Power.  Experts should be able to use it and not feel limited.

* Small Core.  The core language should be simple and compact.
  Modules provide additional functionality.

* Extensible.  Hecl may be used to extend Hecl, as well as Java, of
  course.  The syntax is flexible enough that it is possible to create
  new control structures, for example, entirely in Hecl itself.

* Embeddable.  Hecl is easy to embed into your own Java applications.

* JavaME/J2ME.  Hecl is built to run in Java ME, which provides a much
  smaller API than 'regular' Java.

To get started, read the INSTALL file and the documentation, starting
with docs/index.html.
